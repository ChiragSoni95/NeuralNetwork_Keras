# NeuralNetwork_Keras
 First neural network model using the powerful Keras Python library for deep learning.
1. train.py: includes defining, compiling, fitting, and evaluating a model on the training data(AVAILABLE HERE: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv)
2. test.py: makes prediction on test data.(Here, training and testing data is the same. You can try for different test set if its available in the same format as that of training data).Running this prints the predictions for each input pattern. We could use these predictions directly in our application if/as needed.
